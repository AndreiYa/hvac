								I had a leak from the AC and we got by with  running portable AC for a while because I really hate dealing with vendors who can be so shady.  Now at home mostly with this pandemic I knew I had to get this fixed before the geat wave comes.  I finally settled on Sergei after reading the reviews for quite a few vendors.  I had to wait a few days for him to come but that just showed that he is a popular man. Lol.  

								He was quick in response and was prompt on his appt.  He inspected and showed us pictures of the issue to clearly point out the problem.  Our condenser coil was covered in dust, freezing the inside, and when it melted it leaked amongst many other issues.  He gave us 3 different options which included trying to clean the coil, but he admitted up front that this option would not come with any guarantee that it would work, as coils are not meant to be cleaned.  The other option was to replace the coil and condenser (the outside unit), and he gave us two models to choose from.  After discussing the two estimates that he left us with, we chose to replace the 25 year old unit with a new AC unit.  It was a lot more than the cleaning option, but the quote was excellent for a 3 ton AC unit.  Sergei's explanation of different options really sold us.  

								I really appreciated the fact that he gave a through explanations and options.   And the thing is, he gave us a free estimate so when he left we could have easily called another company, if we did not feel he was being honest with us or something.  I felt that Sergei was very professional and trustworthy.  

								Installation took place after they set down sheets and covered furnitures near the attic.  After the day long installation, Sergei took some time to explain what future maintenance might be needed and types of filters (Mer 8) to use for efficiency.  I enjoyed using HVAC and will recommend him to my friends and family.  AC works great now.  Thanks.

								Had two American Standard heat pumps installed by HVAC Heating and Air and had a great experience, even under the COVID19 epedemic. They exceeded my expectations and worked closely with me to understand what I wanted. I found an HVAC company to turn to and trust going forward. Thank you for all your help Sergei.

								The AC system for the house we own in Orange was running but not cooling the house down; the tenant was frantic and we needed to have it fixed ASAP.  I found Sergei on Yelp and called him to schedule an appointment.  He turned out to be an exceptional professional - I'm really glad I called him!

								First off, Sergei is a both reliable and a great communicator; he gave us an appointment for the next day.  He not only arrived on time, but he called 20 minutes before he got there to reconfirm and give us a heads up.

								It turned out that we had two problems with our AC.  First, the coolant was low.  Sergei fixed that problem and our system seemed to be working OK, but I called him back the next week because it still wasn't cooling the house down.  When he came out again, he went through an exhaustive diagnostic process and determined that our thermostat was defective; it wasn't sending the compressor the signal necessary to have it turn on even though it was blowing air through the vents in the house.

								Sergei installed a replacement thermostat and our AC system has now been working perfectly for a couple of months.  Not only that but the new thermostat is driven by Google Nest, so it's connected to the Internet and can be controlled from a smartphone even if no one is in the house - how cool is that!?

								I wouldn't hesitate to call Sergei again down the road if we have any further problems.  I highly recommend his services to anyone who needs an honest, exceptional professional to assist them with air conditioning repair, service, or installation.

								Thanks Sergei!!

								Sergi provided me with the best experience! Super nice guy and extremely reasonable pricing.
								I purchased an Ecobee4 and was unable to get it working even after contacting Ecobee support.
								Sergi, arrived on time and within minutes discovered the issue and fixed it! He made sure that it functioned with both the AC and heater before he left.
								If ever I have issues with my heating or AC I will definitely contact him again. I would happily refer him to all my family and friends.

								Sergi came out today to check my ac unit since it wasn't blowing out cold air. I called at 8 am, Monday morning and we agreed for for him to come out around 8:45 to inspect my unit. 8:45, on the dot he called to say he was outside.

								I must say I'm surprised as he was very through with the inspection and honest in regards to providing information on what needs to be immediately fixed and what could be held off.

								He did keep his word and provided me with special Yelp pricing.

								If you are in the OC area and need a guy to work on your AC/Heater, Sergi is your guy!!

								Sergei from HVAC helped me install a new AC unit and furnace. When I reached out to him about my AC not working, he immediately called me back and took the time to answer all my questions, explain the process and my options. I was lucky he was available that day to come and inspect my AC.  Overall, Sergei is thorough, skillful, experienced and professional.  This was one of my best experiences in paying for a big yet important installation. The advice he gave me was honest, price was reasonable, and quality of service exceptional. He and his team were thorough, skillful, and genuinely cared about my concerns as a customer.  Sergei is someone I can trust to go to with any HVAC problems I might encounter in the future and I will definitely refer him to all my close friends and family .
